            The Unified Energy Interface, or UEI, emerges as a way of unifying
            the fragmented digital attempts spread across the domain of energy
            transactions. Built on the open-source Beckn Protocol, which also
            powers networks like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Namma
            Yatri, Unified Health Interface (UHI) and Open Network for Education
            & Skilling Transformations (ONEST), UEI is designed as an open
            network specifically for energy transactions. This network links
            various digital platforms – those dealing in energy and its
            derivatives – enabling them to interact and transact through a
            common, interoperable language.

            UEI essentially creates a unified ecosystem, integrating disparate
            energy solutions into a cohesive whole. It acts as a dynamic open
            network where providers and consumers of energy-related services,
            such as EV charging, battery swapping, renewable energy, and many
            more can seamlessly connect. They use a standardised vocabulary,
            fostering an inclusive yet competitive environment that encourages
            innovation. This interface not only simplifies transactions but also
            propels the sector towards more efficient and sustainable energy
            use.
